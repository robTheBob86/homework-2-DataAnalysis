# Homework 2: Data Analysis

This is the second homework of the module Data Analysis from the Technical University of Munich.

Unfortenately I am not allowed to upload neither the task nor the dataset, here is however my script and the parser for the 
dataset, which was given in .txt format. 

Please note that I squeezed some plotting into distinct functions, because I wanted to comment that out in one simple step.
